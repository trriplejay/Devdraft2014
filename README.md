## DevDraft 2014 (Python)##

This hub contains my python implementations of the solutions to the DevDraft 2014 challenges.  There were 3 main coding challenges.

### Train shortest path: DevDraftFinals1.py###
Summary: You are given an input list of several trains, their stops, and the cost for each stop.  They all start at point 0 and go to point N, find the least costly path for a passenger from 0 to N if they are allowed to switch trains without limit or penalty.  Each train can have a different number of stops with a different cost per stop.

### Matchmaking System: DevDraftFinals3.py###
Summary: Given an input list of players and their Elo rating, add the players to a matchmaking pool and match the players together based on certain conditions given in the input file.  Sum up the total matches made for the given input.

### Debugging: DevDraftFinals5.py###
Summary: given some pre-existing but incorrectly functioning methods, find and correct as many issues as you can.  The given testcases don't cover all scenarios.
